It document is made for experimenters. It will help them understand what the "Art information experiment" is about.
Context:
Museum are usualy seen as boring or out dated. To improve their visit, a solution would be to show them adabtive content.
To show adabtive content, we need first to detect interess.
THe hypothesis we want to test is "one's level of inters is linked to his physical stat,
 for exemple heart beat, temperature or eye gaze"
We also want to see if it's possible to provoque the flow stat of mind

First: What is the experiement?
To test this hyposthesis, the user is place in front of the computert  to interact with 3 different art pieces 
each one with a different way for giving imformations. (text, video or mignifing glass)
Their reaction will be recorded with a camera, a thermo camera, an eye tracker, and a E4.
Then the user will be asked questions about the experiement.



Second:What are the goals of this experiement? 
They 3 real objective with the experiement.
First is to determent what is the best way to display information about an art piece 
 between text, video, magnified glasses.
Secondly, is to detect and maybe provoque the state of flow. 
Thirdly, is to record data about interess and physical reaction. We want to analyse the data to detect interess.



What software will be used?
Recording programme:

This programme is made with C#. It can be found in the file... 



E4



DNP magnified glasses





and my record program

and E4



How to chose the art?

How to the experiment?

First: explaine to the user the goal of the experiment: 
exemple of speech:""
